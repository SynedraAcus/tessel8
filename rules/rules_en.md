## Components

Tokens are all tetramino-shaped and two-sided. Each token has a basic side and
an improved side (the one with background lines); the difference between them is
that a basic side always has 4 different gems, and an improved one always has
two identical gems near one another. The token is called "improved" or "basic"
depending on which side is up.

## Before game

1. Select a field
2. Pick four tokens for each player (two basic and two improved) and place them
before that player so that they are visible to the other player. This is called
the player's hand.
3. Decide who's going to be the first player

## Gameplay

If at the beginning of player's turn he has less than five tokens before him, he
draws one basic token. After that, he places one of his tokens on the field;
tokens are not allowed to overlap each other or field edges, but otherwise a player
can place his token wherever they want. If this creates a group of 3+ gems:

* A group of 3 gems: an active player selects one of the tokens in this group,
removes it from the field, and places it in his victory heap
* A group of 4 gems: same as above, and active player also selects one more
token from the same group, removes it from the field and places it before him
(either side up). The player may check the bottom side of all tokens before
selecting. After that, he may place another token on the field following the
same rules, but does not draw a token.
* A group of 5+ gems: player removes all tokens in this group from the field
and spreads them between his victory heap and his hand however he wants
(either side up), except that he's not allowed to have more than 5 tokens
before him.

If, by placing a single token, the player has assembled multiple groups with
the same number of gems, they are considered a single group of next tier (ie
2 groups of 3 gems are considered a group of 4 gems, and 2 groups of 4 gems
are a group of 5 gems). If there are multiple groups of different tiers (for
example, a group of 4 and a group of 3), the biggest one is resolved first.
If, after that, there are still groups of 3+ gems on the table, they are
resolved one after another by the same rules until none remain.

After a player has placed at least one token and resolved all groups that he
has created, his turn ends and the next player takes his turn.

If none of the player's tokens can be placed on the field, the player skips a
turn. Note that you cannot just decide to skip a turn: if a token can be placed
(even if it doesn't benefit you), it must be placed.


## Ending the game

If both players skip their turns in a row, or if there are no tokens left to
draw, the game is over. Each player gets one point for each token in his victory
heap and one point for each improved token in his had. The player with most
points wins.
